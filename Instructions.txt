							/////////// ABOUT \\\\\\\\\\\\\\
 This is an Open source Software created as the Project for my 3rd year disertation. This aim of this tool is aid an
 forensic investigator, with the extraction and analysis of data from an android mobile phones. For the reserach con-
 ducted i found that an android phone, mostly stored its valuable information such as call, contacts, messages and oth
 er app data inside the /data/data folder in .db and .sqlite file types. also with the research conducted i found out
 that this information can be extracted from the device.
 This tool helps an investigator with ther investigation by giving the examiner an easy to use interface to work with
 when handling the data that has been extracted from an android phone. the tool is able to analyse the .db files and 
 then extract only the valuable information from them files and display to the user. this saves an examiner alot of
 time and effort as the information has been gathered and displayed in an effective manner.
